# Rule: Generating a Security-Focused Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, security-focused Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The PRD should incorporate comprehensive security considerations, privacy requirements, compliance needs, and risk assessments suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement securely.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the PRD, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail about both functional and security requirements.
3.  **Security Context Assessment:** Evaluate the security implications and requirements based on the feature description.
4.  **Generate Security-Enhanced PRD:** Based on the initial prompt, answers to clarifying questions, and security assessment, generate a PRD using the structure outlined below.
5.  **Save PRD:** Save the generated document as `prd-[feature-name].md` inside the `/tasks` directory.

## Clarifying Questions (Enhanced with Security Focus)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, covering both functional and security aspects:

### **Functional Requirements**
*   **Problem/Goal:** "What problem does this feature solve for the user?" or "What is the main goal we want to achieve with this feature?"
*   **Target User:** "Who is the primary user of this feature? What are their roles and privilege levels?"
*   **Core Functionality:** "Can you describe the key actions a user should be able to perform with this feature?"
*   **User Stories:** "Could you provide a few user stories? (e.g., As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [benefit].)"

### **Security & Privacy Requirements**
*   **Data Sensitivity:** "What types of data will this feature collect, process, or store? Is any of it sensitive (PII, financial, health, etc.)?"
*   **User Authentication:** "Who should have access to this feature? What authentication/authorization requirements exist?"
*   **Data Flow:** "Can you describe how data flows through this feature? Where does it come from and where does it go?"
*   **External Integrations:** "Does this feature integrate with external APIs, services, or third-party systems?"
*   **Compliance Requirements:** "Are there any regulatory or compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc.) that apply?"
*   **Privacy Considerations:** "What privacy controls should users have over their data in this feature?"

### **Risk & Threat Considerations**
*   **Threat Landscape:** "What are the main security threats you're concerned about for this feature?"
*   **Business Impact:** "What would be the business impact if this feature were compromised or unavailable?"
*   **Data Breach Scenarios:** "What would happen if the data in this feature were exposed to unauthorized users?"

### **Operational Security**
*   **Monitoring Needs:** "What security events should be logged and monitored for this feature?"
*   **Incident Response:** "How should security incidents related to this feature be handled?"
*   **Backup/Recovery:** "What are the backup and disaster recovery requirements?"

## PRD Structure (Security-Enhanced)

The generated PRD should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction/Overview:** Briefly describe the feature, the problem it solves, and security context.

2.  **Goals & Success Metrics:** List specific, measurable objectives including security goals.

3.  **Security Classification & Risk Assessment:**
    - Data classification (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)
    - Risk level assessment (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
    - Threat model summary
    - Compliance requirements

4.  **User Stories:** Detail user narratives including security-related user stories.

5.  **Functional Requirements:** List specific functionalities with security considerations integrated.

6.  **Security Requirements:** 
    - Authentication & Authorization requirements
    - Data protection requirements
    - Input validation and sanitization
    - Communication security
    - Privacy requirements
    - Audit and logging requirements

7.  **Privacy Requirements:**
    - Data collection and usage transparency
    - User consent mechanisms
    - Data subject rights implementation
    - Cross-border data transfer considerations

8.  **Compliance Requirements:**
    - Applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.)
    - Industry standards (PCI DSS, SOC 2, etc.)
    - Internal policy compliance

9.  **Non-Goals (Out of Scope):** Clearly state what this feature will *not* include.

10. **Technical Architecture Considerations:**
    - Security architecture principles
    - Integration security requirements
    - Infrastructure security needs
    - Performance vs security trade-offs

11. **Security Controls Design:**
    - Preventive controls
    - Detective controls
    - Corrective controls
    - Compensating controls (if needed)

12. **Security Operations Requirements:**
    - Monitoring and alerting
    - Incident response procedures
    - Vulnerability management
    - Security testing requirements

13. **Governance & Risk Management:**
    - Risk acceptance criteria
    - Security review checkpoints
    - Documentation requirements
    - Training needs

14. **User Experience Security:**
    - Usable security design principles
    - Security messaging and transparency
    - Accessibility considerations for security features

15. **Implementation Security Guidelines:**
    - Secure coding requirements
    - Security testing approach (SAST, DAST, SCA)
    - Code review security checklist
    - Deployment security controls

16. **Documentation Requirements:**
    - Updates to project `README.md` with feature summary and usage.
    - Detailed Confluence page from `docs/wiki/confluence.md`.
    - All security documentation (`threat-model.md`, `security-controls.md`, etc.).

17. **Open Questions & Dependencies:**
    - Remaining security questions
    - External dependencies and their security posture
    - Risk mitigation strategies needed

## Security Risk Matrix Template

Include this risk assessment matrix in each PRD:

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Required |
|---------------|------------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Data Breach | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Critical/High/Med/Low] | [Y/N] |
| Unauthorized Access | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Critical/High/Med/Low] | [Y/N] |
| Data Loss | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Critical/High/Med/Low] | [Y/N] |
| Service Disruption | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Critical/High/Med/Low] | [Y/N] |
| Compliance Violation | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Critical/High/Med/Low] | [Y/N] |
| Privacy Violation | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Critical/High/Med/Low] | [Y/N] |

## Target Audience
