# üîê Security-Enhanced AI Dev Tasks for Cursor ü§ñ

Welcome to **Security-Enhanced AI Dev Tasks**! This enhanced workflow provides a comprehensive security-first approach to feature development within the [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) editor. By integrating security considerations, privacy requirements, compliance validation, and risk assessment throughout the development lifecycle, you can build secure, compliant, and resilient features with AI assistance.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security-First Philosophy

Building secure software with AI requires a systematic approach that integrates security from the very beginning. This enhanced workflow ensures that:

1. **Security by Design:** Security considerations are embedded from PRD creation through deployment
2. **Comprehensive Risk Management:** Threat modeling and risk assessment guide development decisions
3. **Compliance Integration:** Regulatory and policy requirements are validated throughout the process
4. **Privacy Protection:** Privacy-by-design principles are applied consistently
5. **Operational Security:** Security monitoring, incident response, and governance are planned from the start

## üöÄ Enhanced Workflow: From Secure Idea to Secure Implementation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Security-Enhanced Product Requirement Document (PRD)

Start with a comprehensive PRD that integrates security, privacy, and compliance requirements from the beginning.

**Using the Security-Enhanced PRD Template:**

1. Ensure you have the `create-prd-secure.mdc` file accessible
2. In Cursor's Agent chat, initiate secure PRD creation:

    ```
    Use @create-prd-secure.mdc and @security-template.md
    Here's the feature I want to build: [Describe your feature in detail]
    Security context: [Describe any known security requirements, data sensitivity, compliance needs]
    Reference these files: [Optional: @file1.py @file2.ts]
    ```

**The AI will ask comprehensive security-focused questions including:**
- Data sensitivity and classification requirements
- Authentication and authorization needs
- Compliance and regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc.)
- Privacy considerations and user consent requirements
- Threat landscape and business impact concerns
- Monitoring and incident response needs

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Your Security-Focused Task List

Transform your security-enhanced PRD into a detailed implementation plan with integrated security controls.

1. Ensure you have `generate-tasks-secure.mdc` accessible
2. In Cursor's Agent chat, create security-focused tasks:

    ```
    Now take @MyFeature-PRD.md and create tasks using @generate-tasks-secure.mdc with @security-template.md
    ```

**The generated task list includes:**
- **Security Planning & Threat Modeling** tasks
- **Security Architecture & Design** tasks  
- **Secure Implementation** with built-in security controls

- **Deployment Security** requirements

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Security-Enhanced Task Processing

Use the enhanced task processing workflow that includes mandatory security validation at each step.

1. Ensure you have `process-task-list-secure.mdc` accessible
2. Start with the first task:

    ```
    Please start on task 1.1 and use @process-task-list-secure.mdc with @security-template.md
    ```

**Each task completion includes:**
- Implementation of required security controls
- Security testing and validation
- Documentation of security evidence
- Compliance verification (where applicable)
- Risk assessment updates
- Security review checkpoint

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Security Validation and Review
