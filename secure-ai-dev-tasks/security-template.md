## üéØ Implementation Notes

1. **Customize for your context**: Adapt this template based on your specific technology stack, regulatory environment, and risk profile.

2. **Progressive implementation**: Don't try to implement all controls at once. Prioritize based on risk assessment and business requirements.

3. **Regular updates**: Security requirements evolve. Review and update this template regularly based on new threats, regulations, and best practices.

4. **Team training**: Ensure all team members understand these security requirements and their role in implementation.

5. **Security champions**: Designate security champions within development teams to promote security best practices.

6. **Continuous improvement**: Use security incidents and findings to improve this template and associated processes.

**Remember**: Security is not a checkbox exercise. It requires ongoing attention, continuous improvement, and a culture that values security as a fundamental requirement, not an afterthought.
