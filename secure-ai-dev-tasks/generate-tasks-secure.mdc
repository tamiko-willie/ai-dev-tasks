# Rule: Generating a Security-Focused Task List from a PRD

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list with integrated security considerations in Markdown format based on an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD). The task list should guide a developer through secure implementation while ensuring all security requirements, compliance needs, and risk mitigations are properly addressed.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[prd-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-prd-user-profile-editing.md`)
- **Security Template Reference:** Must reference `@security-template.md`

## Process

1.  **Receive PRD Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific PRD file
2.  **Analyze PRD:** The AI reads and analyzes the functional requirements, security requirements, compliance needs, and risk assessments from the specified PRD.
3.  **Security Context Assessment:** Extract and prioritize security requirements, threat models, and compliance obligations.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Based on the PRD analysis, create the file and generate the main, high-level tasks required to implement the feature securely. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level security-focused tasks based on the PRD. Ready to generate the detailed sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Security-Enhanced Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks that include mandatory security checkpoints, validation steps, and compliance verification.
7.  **Security Task Integration:** Ensure each functional task includes corresponding security tasks (threat modeling, security testing, code review, etc.).
8.  **Identify Relevant Files:** Based on the tasks and PRD, identify potential files including security configurations, test files, documentation, and monitoring setup.
9.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine all components into the final security-enhanced Markdown structure.
10. **Save Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/tasks/` directory.

## Security Task Categories

Each task list must include tasks from these categories:

### **1. Security Planning & Design**
- Threat modeling and risk assessment
- Security architecture review
- Privacy impact assessment
- Compliance validation planning

### **2. Secure Implementation**

### **4. Security Operations**
- Logging and monitoring setup
- Incident response procedures
- Security documentation
- Security training materials

### **5. Compliance & Governance**

## Output Format (Security-Enhanced)

The generated task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed security-enhanced sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level security plan aligns with user expectations before diving into implementation details.

## Security Integration Requirements

Every functional task must include:
1. **Security validation steps**
2. **Threat mitigation measures**
3. **Compliance verification**
4. **Security testing requirements**
5. **Monitoring and alerting setup**
6. **Documentation requirements**

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader includes:
- **Junior developers** who need clear, secure implementation guidance
- **Security engineers** who need to validate security controls
- **DevOps engineers** who need to implement security operations
- **Compliance officers** who need to verify regulatory adherence

## Security Testing Integration

Each task list must include comprehensive security testing:
- **Unit Tests:** Security-focused unit tests for each component
- **Integration Tests:** Security validation across component boundaries
- **End-to-End Tests:** Complete security workflow validation
- **Performance Tests:** Security control performance impact
- **Compliance Tests:** Regulatory requirement validation

## Mandatory Security Documentation

Each task list must include creation of:
- **Threat Model Document**
- **Security Controls Documentation**
- **Privacy Impact Assessment** (if PII is involved)
- **Incident Response Procedures**
- **Security Operations Runbook**
- **Compliance Validation Report**

## Security Validation Criteria

Before marking any security-related task as complete:
1. Security controls are implemented and tested
2. Threat mitigations are in place and validated
3. Compliance requirements are met and documented
4. Security testing passes all acceptance criteria
5. Security documentation is complete and reviewed
6. Monitoring and alerting are configured and tested

## Final Instructions

1. **Always reference the security template** (`@security-template.md`) when generating tasks
2. **Include mandatory security checkpoints** for each phase
3. **Ensure security tasks are specific and measurable**
4. **Integrate security throughout the development lifecycle**
5. **Plan for security operations and incident response**
6. **Document all security assumptions and decisions**
7. **Include compliance validation at every appropriate step**
8. **Design for security by default, not as an afterthought**
